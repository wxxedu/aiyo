# Aiyo

## Hackathon Submission Details

### Inspiration

Aiyoh, coding so sian one, ah boy! Auntie see already also want to cry for you. Why your face so stress, ah? Come, Auntie help you make your coding more fun and shiok! That’s how Auntie Aiyo was born—laughter is the best medicine, mah, even for spaghetti code!

### What it does

Auntie Aiyo will help you write better code, leh! She auto-generate funny-funny Singlish comments to cheer you up while suan-ing you a bit for your messy logic and bugs. Useful lah, confirm make your coding life less dry and boring.

### How we built it

Wah, so much effort! Auntie team used **LangChain** to make sure I can understand your code, so I don’t anyhow talk cock, okay? Then we use **OpenAI** to power my jokes and suan-ning—you know lah, my humor must be top-tier zhun. Everything sibeh solid, built using **Node.js** and **TypeScript** to create the VSCode extension. You say power or not?

### Challenges we ran into

- Aiyoh, how to make jokes funny but still useful? Don’t waste people’s time lah.
- So chim, ah! Make Auntie understand your code properly—headache lah.
- Auntie don’t want to offend you, ah! How to suan without people take heart?

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Shiok lah, got a plugin now that combines Singlish humor with productivity.
- Developers tell Auntie, “Wah, so funny and useful!” Make Auntie very touched, okay?
- Bringing our local culture into the coding world—steady lah!

### What we learned

- Relatable humor confirm win, especially with Singlish, mah.
- Fun and function must balance—cannot just suan-suan for nothing, okay?
- Developers really need to laugh more while working—don’t so stress, lah!

### What's next for Auntie Aiyo

- Aiyoh, maybe I try other accents or languages, like Aussie slang or British humor?
- More jokes and suan-ning based on feedback—you tell Auntie what you want, lah!
- Make my comments even more zhun, okay? Must keep improving.
- Allow you to choose the level of suan—mild-mild or savage roast? Your call, lah.
- Expand to other IDEs, like JetBrains or Visual Studio. Auntie don’t want to bojio anyone!
